    <h1>Homework 3</h1>
    <h3>In this project I was able to show the same project in different projections by changing the Project Coordinate
      Reference System (CRS) through the project properties tab.

   <h1>WGS84 Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./maps/4326.png">
   </a>
   <p> With the WGS84 projection, we see that similar to the Mercator projection size is increasingly distorted 
    the further an object is from the equater. Unlike the mercator projection however lines of latitude are not spaced further apart
    closer to the poles, resulting in objects closer to the poles to appear wider, but maintaining the same hight.

   <h1>Aitoff Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./maps/AitoffProjection.png">
   </a>
   <p>The Aitoff projection does a much better at avoiding size distortions, seeking a show a more spherical representation on a 2d plane.
    Objects along both the prime meridian and the equator are the least distored, with the intersection of the two having no distortion. 
    However, both lines of latitude and longitude are heavily distorted towards the corners of the maps, resulting in objects toward the corners 
    having both highly distored shapes and sizes.

   <h1>3857, Pseado Mercator Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewEPSG3857.png">
   </a>
   <p>is similar to the WGS84 projection. The core difference between the two is that while objects 
    do get larger the further they are from the equator  in the Psedo Mercator Projection
    proportionality is maintained between hight and width.
    This means that shape is preserved while area is heavily distored.</p>

   <h1>53018, Sphere Winkle Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI53018.png">
   </a>
   <p>The Sphere Winkle projection seeks to provide a more spherical representation by adding curvature to lines of 
    latitude. In doing so, the Sphere Winkle projection eliminates most but not all of the area issues caused by the 
  Mercator projection, but in turn causes increasingly distored shapes the further an object is from the prime meridian.</p>

   <h1>54034, World Cyldrical Equal Area Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI54034.png">
   </a>
   <P>The World Cyldrical Equal Area Projection, is a cylndrical projection much like the Mercator and WGS84 projections.
    Unlike the other two projections the World Cyldrical Equal Area Projection seeks to perserve area, as such objects are
    increasingly streched east-west the further they are from the equator. This results in a map where size is maintained, but 
    shapes are heavily distored towards the polare regions.

   <h1>54027, Equidistant Conic Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI54027.png">
   </a>
   <p>The Equidistant Conic Projection, seeks to project Earth onto a cone where the peak of the cone is the North Pole. This map,
    is useful for showing great circle distances in the Northern Hemishpere, but casuses great East-West distortion in addition to size 
    distortion the further objects are from the line of latitude halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.</p>

   <a href="./newMaps/NewESRI102016.png">
   <h1>102016, North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI102016.png">
  </a>
   <p>The North Pole Azimuthal Projection is similar to the Equadistant Conic Projection. This projection seeks to project Earth onto
    a flat circle centered on the North Pole rather than a cone centered on the North Pole. Indeed, we can see that the maps shows 
    continuous lines of latitude and that lines longitude cut straight across the North Pole.

   <h1>53024, Sphere Bonne</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI 53024.png">
   </a>
   <p>The Sphere Bonne projection results in an almost 'heart shaped' projection, where the area surrounding the 
    North Pole simialar to a conic projection, but area around the South Pole wraps up simialar to a spherical projection.
    This method compensates for some of the shape and size distortions found in the Conic and Azimuthal projections, but still
    features a great deal of distortion apart from objects directly on the Prime Meridian or Arctic Circle.

   <h1>54021, World Polyconic Projection</h1>
   <img width="800" src="./newMaps/NewESRI54021.png">
   </a>
   <P>The World Polyconic Projection seeks to compensate for the immense size distortions in the Equidistant Conic Projection by
    providing two peaks for a cone, at both the North and South Poles. This projection excells at showing great circle distances in
    both hemispheres across the prime meridian, but results in high levels of size distrtion the further an object is from the Prime Meridian
    or the Polar Regions.
