      As climate change accelerates the melting of the Polar Ice Caps, the Arctic Ocean will
      increasingly be open for resource extraction by countries and corperations. The exploitation and
      extraction of all resources are governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLS).
      For this map I went over two of the main categories under (UNCLS), the first being territorial waters
      and the second being exlusive economic zones (EEZs). Territorial water extend for 12 nautical miles
      from a country's coastline and represent the areas in which stateshave full jursidiction. EEZ's
      extend 200 miles from a countries coast and represent the area in which countries have exlusive rights
      to natural resources in and below the surface of the water, but where all vessels are granted free
      passage in peace time.

      For this project I used a combination of buffers and subtractions. Originally I added a shapefile 
      containing all
      of the countries of the world. Next, using the selection tool I selected the countries 
      that are in the 
      Northern Hemisphere and that I intedned to have in my map. Usingthe selected countries 
      only I created 
      a buffer of 13.8 miles, which is roughly equivlent to 12 nautical miles. 
      This buffer I created
      a buffer around the entire border of a county, including areas on land. This buffer layer additonally, covered all
      of the land of the country. In order to only see the territorial waters I subtracted the layer containing all of countries
      from the newly created buffer layer, leaving me with a layer which only showed a strip of water 12 nautical miles off of land.
      I repreated this same process to create an EEZ layer. Finally, I used a dissolve method to combine all of the polygons into open
      to show the total extent of water occupied by territorial waters and EEZs.
