      <h1>Homework 7</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
     <p> As a European Studies Major and as a Turkish-American I am deeply intrested in Turkish
        politics, as such, for this project I decided to create both a cloropleth and a proportional symbol map showcasing the results of the 
        2023 Turkish Presidential Election. I acquired the data for this project from the website of the Turkish
        <a href="https://www.ysk.gov.tr/tr/2023-cumhurbaskani-ve-milletvekili-secim-i%CC%87statistikleri/1541626"> Supreme 
        Electoral Board (YSK)</a>. The data I aquired only showcased the total amount of votes recieved by candidate in each
        province. While creating my cleaned CSV, I added up the votes all candidates recieved by province to calculate the total
        votes cast in each province. This, in turn, allowed me to calculate the precentage of votes recieved by each candidate in 
        each province which I then used to create my coloropleth. I created the coloropleth using two different layers; one layer using
        the vote precentage of Erdoğan and the other using that of Kılıçdaroğlu. For both candidates I creates six breaks
        (0-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-55, 55-60, and 60-100), placing most of the emphasis on swing provinces while creating less distinction
        between provinces safely won by one party. I placed the layer for Kılıçdaroğlu above that for 
        Erdoğan and hid the provinces where Kılıçdaroğlurecıeved less than 40% of the voteö which allowed for the Erdoğan
        layer to be visible from underneath. Due to the fact that there were two third-party candidates there were also 
        party challengers I had to account for provinces where the candidate that recieved the most recieved less than a majority.
        To do acomplish this I used the rules based formating option to specificy that for the Kılıçdaroğlu layer objects in the 
        45-50 category had to be both between 45 and 50 AND that the Kılıçdaroğlu vote had to be larger than the Erdoğan vote share.
        Additionally, for the pie chart I decided to make the pie chart of each province proportional to the amount of votes cast
        in that province.
