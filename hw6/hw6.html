      <br>
      <p>For the followings maps I aquired data from the Census Bureau on the 
        number of household receiving snap benefits per county in Ohio. To account for population 
        diffrences between counties I created a ratio using the total population estimates per 
        county. By diving the total number of SNAP recipients per county by the total population 
        estimate per county and mutiplying the total by 100 I was able to get the number of SNAP 
        recipients.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I was hoping to be able to find the total number of households per county because it is not
        clear how many people are in a household. Additionally the average numbe of people in a household
        might vary from region to region. For instance, urban areas might have a fewer number of people 
        living in each household whereas rural areas might have a greater number of people per household.
        Regardless, creating a ratio for population still accounts for and normalizes by population density.

      <H1>Jenks Breaks Categorization</H1>
      <img width="800" src="Part2Maps/JennksBreaks.png">
      <br> 
      <p>The 'Jenks Breaks' categorization does a decent job for the most part of splitting categories at natural break points.
        One of the properties of Jenks Breaks is that certain categories span a large number of values while only containing a
        few instances. This is beneficial for showing diffrences in magnitude between different instances with large diffrences in
        values, but makes it difficult to differntiate between instances that have values closer together.

      </p>

      <h1>Equal Counts Categorization</h1> 
      <img width="800" src="./Part2Maps/EqualSizeBreaks.png">
      <br>
      <p>The 'Equal Counts' categorization has an equal number of instances in each category. This categorization method
        takes no regard for whether two values are close or far apart. While this map does utilize the full extent of each 
        category, it forces some values that are far apart into the same category while splitting apart other ones.
      <br>
      <br> 
      <h1>Pretty Breaks Categorization</h1> 
      <img width="800" src="./Part2Maps/PrettyBreak.png">
      <p>The "Pretty Breaks' category is certainly pretty, at least in terms of number. However the breaks being pretty 
        and at constant intervals means that, again no attention is paid to the concentration of differening instances
        and thier values. Some categories have many values, some have few if not none at all.
